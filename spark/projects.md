### List of End to End projects in spark

#### Word Count and Log processing examples in slides

These examples are present in the Intro to spark slides that I prepared. In order to showcase hello world programs to students, these two examples can serve as perfect initial assignments for the course. Data set will be easily available for both the examples.

#### Extending the log procesing example to have few integrations with other systems:
- Storing cleaned data in some data store like Cassandra, s3, . This will involve the example of how to communicate with cassandra or other data sources.
- Querying the data using sparkSQL or cassandra queries.

The above two projects can act as starting point for students to get their hands dirty with spark functionalities. Infact, they are very neccessary to understand the workflow of RDD, traformations and actions. 

#### Music recomendation Engine
- This is an example from book "Advanced Analytics with Spark - Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen, and Josh Wills" . Its chapter 3 in the book.
- Data set is readily available.
- Involves understanding of collaborative recomendation algorithms (The book uses Alternating Least Squares Recommender Algorithm)
- Can be used for movie recomendation as well. Data set is available at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
- Can be implemented from end to end using Python.

#### A toy example of Lambda architecture for real-time analysis of hashtags in twitter. 
- https://github.com/pereferrera/trident-lambda-splout
- This example can be converted to work with spark. As spark has both offline and online processing capabilitites, this can be very good example for a project.
- Data set can be easily available from twitter API.
- Can be implemented from end to end using Python.

#### Social network analysis by lambda architecture:
- http://www.drdobbs.com/database/applying-the-big-data-lambda-architectur/240162604
- This is interesting project. But somewhat difficult to obtain data set.
- User tries to find relation between users by mining their different social profiles: facebook, twitter, linkedIn, google+.  "I want to be able to capture whether I happen to know someone from multiple social networks, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, or from real-life circumstances" - [webpage](http://www.drdobbs.com/database/applying-the-big-data-lambda-architectur/240162604)
