## Music/Movie recomendation Engine

### Overview
The goal of recomendation sysem is to predict the preference of user. For e.g, which movies the user will like, which products user will buy on amazon based on his/her past history.

### Data Set and Sample Code repositories
- Music recomendation example from book "Advanced Analytics with Spark - Sandy Ryza, Uri Laserson, Sean Owen, and Josh Wills" . Data set is readily available at [link](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~bergstrj/audioscrobbler_data.html). The example uses Collaborative technique for 

### Literature available:
- Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets - Yifan Hu, Yehuda Koren, Chris Volinsky [link](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/cf.pdf)


### Famous Algorithms used:

Data set is readily available for both Movie and Music.
Algorithmic Perspective:

Involves understanding of collaborative recomendation algorithms (The book uses Alternating Least Squares Recommender Algorithm)
Example implementaions:

Can be implemented from end to end using Python.
