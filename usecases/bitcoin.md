## Bitcoin Data, and other resources

###Overview
Bitcoin [(bitcoin.org)](https://bitcoin.org/en/) is a digital, cryptographically secure currency. Bitcoin allows users to securely and anonymously retain and transfer value in a decentralized P2P network, and is one of the largest open microeconomic transaction network datasets available. 


###Dataset and Sample Code Repository
- A bitcoin dataset extracted from it's inception to April 7, 2012, containing 6.2M nodes and 37M directed, weighted, time-stamped edges. This new dataset, its metadata, and extraction code is available at:[Bitcoin Transaction Network Dataset](http://compbio.cs.uic.edu/data/bitcoin/)

- Useful Bitcoin Data Resources : http://www.coindesk.com/9-useful-bitcoin-data-resources/
