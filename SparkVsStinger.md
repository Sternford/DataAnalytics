## Out of the box Algorithms provided:
### Apache Spark

- ConnectedComponents: Label Connected components in graph. 
- Label Propagation algorithm
- PageRank algorithm implementation
- Implementation of SVD++ algorithm
- ShortestPaths: Computes shortest paths to the given set of landmark vertices, returning a graph where each vertex attribute is a map containing the shortest-path distance to each reachable landmark
- Strongly connected components
- TriangleCount: Compute the number of triangles passing through each vertex
- In addition to that, there are many third party implementations of various algorithms available.

### STINGER
- Connected components: Accurately tracks the connected components of a graph with insertions and deletions.
- Clustering coefficients: Tracks the local and global clustering coefficients of a graph under both edge insertions and deletions.
- Community detection: Track and update the community structures within the graph as they change.
- Agglomerative clustering: Find clusters that are optimized for a user-defined edge scoring function.
- Betweenness Centrality: Find the key points within information flows and structural vulnerabilities.
- K-core Extraction: Extract additional communities and filter noisy high-degree vertices.
- Classic breadth-first search: Performs a parallel breadth-first search of the graph starting at a given source vertex to find shortest paths.
